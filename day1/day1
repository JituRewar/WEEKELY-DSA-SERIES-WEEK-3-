Mathematical logic forms the base of many DSA problems.

Efficient integer manipulation helps in solving problems without extra space.

Overflow checks are crucial in integer-based problems.
## 🚀 Problems Solved (LeetCode)

### 1️⃣ [7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)
**Concepts Used:** Integer overflow handling, modulus and division for digit extraction.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        long rev = 0;
        while (x != 0) {
            int digit = x % 10;
            rev = rev * 10 + digit;
            x /= 10;
            if (rev > INT_MAX || rev < INT_MIN)
                return 0;
        }
        return (int)rev;
    }
};




2️⃣ 9. Palindrome Number

Concepts Used: Reversing numbers mathematically without converting to string.
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return false;
        long rev = 0, n = x;
        while (n != 0) {
            rev = rev * 10 + (n % 10);
            n /= 10;
        }
        return rev == x;
    }
};
